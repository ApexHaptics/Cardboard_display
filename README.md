This repository is the Google cardboard display for Apex Haptics.
Due to compatability issues with the development phone we are using
version 1.0.3 of the SDK but this can be updated to the current version
for the final builds.

This repository is based upon the "Treasure Hunt" google vr sdk sample and
includes other Google sample code.
